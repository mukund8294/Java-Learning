# ☕ Java Masterclass Learning Repository

Welcome to my Java learning journey! 👋  
This repository documents everything I’m learning from *Tim Buchalka's Java Programming Masterclass* on *Udemy*. It includes notes, hands-on code, mini-projects, and challenges — organized by topic and section.

Whether you're a beginner trying to understand Java or someone revising OOP and GUI basics, feel free to explore the code and learn along with me!

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Learning Java is more than just mastering syntax — it's about developing a problem-solving mindset and writing clean, efficient code.  
This journey has taught me patience, consistency, and curiosity.  
Every class I write and every bug I fix is one step closer to becoming a better developer.

Let’s keep learning. Let’s keep building. 🚀
